## Start game

## Overview

Farkle is a classic dice game that combines strategy and luck. Players take turns rolling six dice, aiming to accumulate points through specific combinations. The first player to reach or exceed 10,000 points wins the game.

## Gameplay

1. On your turn, roll all six dice.
2. After each roll, set aside dice that form scoring combinations.
3. You may choose to:
  - **Bank** your accumulated points and end your turn.
  - **Continue** rolling the remaining dice to try for more points.
4. If you score with all six dice, you have "hot dice" and may roll all six dice again in the same turn.
5. If at any point you roll and no scoring combinations appear, you've "Farkled" and lose all points accumulated in that turn.

## Scoring Combinations

| Combination | Points |
|-------------|--------|
| Single 1 | 100 |
| Single 5 | 50 |
| Three 1s | 1000 |
| Three 2s | 200 |
| Three 3s | 300 |
| Three 4s | 400 |
| Three 5s | 500 |
| Three 6s | 600 |
| Four of a kind | Double the points of three of a kind |
| Five of a kind | Triple the points of three of a kind |
| Six of a kind | Quadruple the points of three of a kind |
| Straight (1-6) | 1500 |
| Three pairs | 1500 |
| Two triplets | 2500 |
| Four of a kind + a pair | 1500 |

## Examples

**Roll:** 1, 1, 1, 5, 5, 2  
**Scoring:** Three 1s = 1000, Two 5s = 100  
**Total:** 1100 points

**Roll:** 2, 2, 3, 3, 4, 4  
**Scoring:** Three pairs = 1500 points

**Roll:** 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6  
**Scoring:** Straight = 1500 points

**Roll:** 2, 3, 4, 6, 6, 2  
**Scoring:** No scoring combinations  
**Result:** Farkle (0 points for this turn)

## Loading Dice

The gamemaster can additionally load any dice to cheat the game.

Create loaded dice by opening the load dice window in the ellipsis menu of the header bar of Farkle.
Drag any Item onto the load window to change the probabilities of the rolls.
You can give this item to any character or player which should be able to use it. On the start of the game each player can select, which loaded dice should be used for the game.
